//! Dedicated deserialization module for semicolon delimited CSV.

//! This module provides support for the alternative CSV input format.
//! The alterative format comes from Excel behaviour with the Italian locale.
//!
//! By default, Excel exports CSV files with:
//! - Semicolon `;` as csv field delimiter
//! - Comma `,` as float decimal delimiter
